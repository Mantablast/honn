If for any reason you change your mind about helping, or decide that you cannot follow through please notify us immediately so that we can re-match the family without delay.  Otherwise it may be a couple of months before it is discovered that nothing is going to arrive, and we can put the family back on the list to await another match and then wait again for a box to arrive.

We strongly discourage the sending of money to any recipient family or to their bank account, via a money order, cheque, Western Union, EMT (Electronic Money Transfer), Paypal or through any other avenues or at least not doing so until you have known them well for a long time and can be sure where their priorities lie.  Once they receive the money they are free to do what they want with it, and that may not be purchasing groceries.  It may be used to play Bingo, purchase items online, buy drugs or alcohol or heaven knows what.  It the past we had someone send a family $200 only to find them bidding $200 in an online auction for a case of pop and then contacting the sending family and the program the same day saying they had no formula or diapers for the baby and asking if we could order some from the coop.  We had another sending family give money to their recipient family so they could purchase Christmas dinner and food for over the holidays only to discover that the entire amount had been wasted when a sister asked for a hamper to be sent to the family as they had nothing for a Christmas dinner and telling the sender that their cupboards were almost empty.  Of course all families are not like that but until you know the people well you do not know into which category they will fall.  If you would like to help with money then please consider putting it on account at the coop or another store where it cannot be withdrawn for cash and can only be used for food and essentials.  Also if you are putting money on account please send only the amount of money you would like them to have for a one time purchase.  If you are sponsoring for instance and you have decided to deposit $800 over the year at the coop it would be much wiser to send $200 each quarter rather than $800 all at once and hope they will use it wisely so it lasts the year.

When you would like to send a NEXT UP box you contact us and let us know the size of family you are able to help.  For these boxes you do not get a choice beyond family size as we try to help people in order in as much as it is possible to do so.  We give you the information about the family and information about any food allergies or medical conditions they may have and any requests they have listed and then you help the family by which ever method you have chosen.  Once you have shipped the box or boxes to the family your obligation is complete and you have no further requirement to do anything.

If you would like the opportunity to get to know another family and to learn about where they live and their culture and traditions as you develop a friendship then perhaps SPONSORING is the program for you.  This is an ongoing commitment to the same family for as long as they need help or until you notify us that you have decided to stop.  With this program you can select the size of family you would like to help and you are also able to make requests such as that you would like a Elder or a single parent, or a family with young children, and we try to find someone who meets your requests as closely as possible.  With the SPONSORSHIP program we request that at a minimum you help the family four times per year, and we ask that you help once each quarter rather than sending four boxes all in one go and then saying you are done for the year.  It is much better to help them once and then let them know the approximate time when the next shipment will arrive.  Our focus is on food and that is all you are obligating yourself to provide but you are welcome to send other items such as clothes, books, DVDs, toys, school and craft supplies and so on if you wish, and you may send things as often as you wish.  Some sponsors help monthly perhaps alternating money at the coop one month and then sending boxes from home the next.  Other sponsors send every other month, and others stick to the four times per year.  Do not allow yourself to become overwhelmed.  Only you know what your finances will allow you to do.  Don\u2019t feel that you need to do more because someone else does.  We have some people who are sponsoring on a small pension while others have virtually unlimited financial resources.  If you find the family needs more help than you are able to give, consider posting a note on the group page and asking someone to join you as a co-sponsor.  You don\u2019t need to live near each other and can decide between yourselves how you would like to handle things - if you would like to alternate shipments or if you would like to take care of different things or whatever works best for both of you.

If you have a question about things to send, or things in general that you don\u2019t understand, please ask us and we will do our best to help.  "}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"21. Please do not send your recipient family religious or other promotional materials.  This program is strictly for sharing food with our neighbours.  We do not promote any other agenda.  It is also not our place to educate others or to tell them how they should lead their lives.  If you are not comfortable with this then perhaps you might consider an alternate avenue to helping individual families as your way to help."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"22. The boxes and other things sent through the Helping Our Northern Neighbours programs are boxes of love and friendship, freely given.  The cost of purchasing the goods and/or shipping is the responsibility of the sending family.  At no time should a receiving family be asked to pay anything in order to receive the boxes.  If necessary, sending families can fundraise to acquire the necessary funds or the membership can be asked to contribute to the cost."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"23. After a northern family fills in an application to receive help we do our best to check them out through references from official members in their community and via all the means available to us.  Please understand though that we are not on the ground and do not have the ability to personally visit each family in order to assess their level of need and verify the information given to us.  Every so often unscrupulous people manage to get in with multiple applications or false information.  As soon as information is given to us about these things or we suspect them we immediately try to get on top of things and check them out more intensely and then act appropriately.  If you suspect things are not as we have indicated to you please let us know so that we can look into things through a wider variety of avenues.  If you see your family selling goods you have sent to them please take a screenshot of their post and let us know right away as this is strictly against our policies and what they have agreed to."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"24. If you have any problems with your recipient family because of rudeness, unreasonable demands, lack of communication or even if things just don\u2019t feel quite right to you, please let us know right away.  Don\u2019t feel uncomfortable and unhappy and just keep it to yourself.  Together we can come up with a plan and perhaps speak to the receiving family to sort things out or maybe you would like to switch to another family or help the people in the north in another way.  Chances are that if it is not working for you it is not working for them either.  Sometimes the fit is just not right and with different matches you may both be happier.  It is not a failure if it doesn\u2019t work.  The next match may work perfectly for both of you."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"25. While it is not up to us to tell others how they should eat or to educate them on nutrition, please concentrate on sending healthy food rather than items which are full of empty calories or are high in sugar and salt.  They may taste good and are fine as treats but are not going to provide nutrition to people who are going hungry.  Before sending unusual items such as couscous, kashi, tofu or other things which may be unfamiliar please ask the family if they would try these things if you included a recipe.  There is no point in sending things that are going to go to waste."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"26. All items sent should be in sealed commercial packaging.  Before sending bulk foods please ask your recipient family if they would be comfortable using these things.  Remember when you are matched you are strangers and they may feel uneasy receiving unsealed items from people they don\u2019t know.  Down the road when you know each other they may be fine with it.  Soup kitchens generally welcome bulk food for their soups, and some families have no problem with it either."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"27. When you receive messages please remember that English may not be the person\u2019s first language so that what you perceive as them being rude may simply be a misunderstanding.  Before jumping on them please bring it to us so we can offer a different perspective and if necessary talk to them."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"28. It is a good idea to keep a notebook with a list of what you send, the size of box, the cost of postage, tracking numbers, the details about a coop order, when things arrived (if you know), items that were very popular with the family and any other such info.  It can be a great reference down the road."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"29. We do not allow any self-matching in our group.  The only way to be fair to everyone is to maintain a list and to help people in the order in which they applied and according to the helpers requests and the urgency of the need.  We take this very seriously and people who self-match after being asked to stop will be removed from the program permanently.  "}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"30. Mailed items may be delayed due to weather and may experience temperature changes several times including freezing.  Please keep this in mind as you consider what to send or the time of the year.

You may wish to consider shipping scented products such as soap in separate packages or with products such as tins where the scent will not be absorbed by food items.  Soap scented oatmeal may not be very palatable."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"32. When sending liquids such as shampoo it is a good idea to tape around the lid and to put these items in a sealed Ziplock bag, so that if they should break or burst if they freeze the fluid will be contained in the bag and will not negatively affect everything in the box."}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"33.
