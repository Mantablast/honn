            <h2>Rules and Eligibility</h2>
            <h4>We are only able to help families living in remote and isolated fly-in communities in the northern parts of Canada.  If you are not in such a community we are afraid we will be unable to help you.  Please request assistance only if you are in dire need of help to feed your family and if family members are regularly missing meals and you are not able to afford adequate food.  We will check on your circumstances before adding you to the list.</h4>
